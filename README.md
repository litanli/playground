# Setup
1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
2. Run `poetry install` from the repository root directory, which should create 
a `.venv` directory containing your virtualenv.
3. To run notebooks select this virtualenv as the kernel. To run scripts run 
`poetry shell` anywhere in the repo.
